# Notes

Just a place for me to dump thoughts for myself while keeping them in version control
(and still semi-visible in case anyone is curious).

## Preliminary notes/thoughts

I'm concerned that it may be difficult to find enough information on this.
There seems to be relatively little (English-language) scholarship dedicated to specific pieces
(and even to the work of some composers in general), compared to the wealth of information
available about concertos by European/American composers.
There is English-language information available outside of a formal scholarly context,
but it's still limited.
Even searching for information about specific pieces by Takemitsu yielded limited results
(outside of a few, like November Steps - although that piece might work).
Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place.

There does at least seem to be a decent amount of repertoire published by Japanese composers
that fits the concerto label.
See [this resource](http://www.musicfromjapan.org/cgi-bin/new/composer.py/search?terms=concerto),
by New York-based group Music From Japan, as an example.

If the idea of writing about contemporary Japanese works doesn't seem like a good direction,
my other thought was just to write about contemporary saxophone concertos.
At any rate, that should be more familiar, although I had hoped to explore some less familiar music.
