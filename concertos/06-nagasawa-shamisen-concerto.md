# 長沢 勝俊 Nagasawa, Katsutoshi - Shamisen Concerto

## Background information

Solo instrument: Shamisen

Composed: 1967

Recording history: This piece was recorded on a CD released by Victor in 1994
(CRD-1079) \[[^1]\], as well as on a recording of a live concert by Pro Musica
Nipponia which was released in 2019 (PMN-004) \[[^2]\].

Premiere and publication information: unable to find.

## Further information

Nagasawa was best known as a founder of the musical group Pro Musica Nipponia, a
group dedicated to performing new works for traditional Japanese instruments
which has performed hundreds of concerts both in Japan and abroad.
He also worked in the world of traditional Japanese theater \[[^3]\]\[[^4]\].

While information on this piece is scarce, it's an interesting example of
a relatively early concerto featuring a traditional Japanese instrument
(in contrast to some of the concertos written for Western instruments around
the same time, like those by [Akio Yashiro](./08-yashiro-piano-concerto.md)).
It exploits some of the unique qualities of the shamisen, including its
ability to do smooth glissandi (it's an unfretted lute-like instrument) and
the characteristic buzziness of its tone.
On top of that, it's short and a nice piece, so I decided to include it.

## Analysis

### Movement I

This movement largely features virtuosic material in the shamisen, which
essentially plays throughout the entire movement.

0:00 - "A" section.

0:28 - "B" section.

0:46 - Back to the "A" section texture.

1:01 - Reappearance of the beginning motif, then moves into what sounds
like a modified "B" section.

1:24 - Pattern repetition, modulating upward.

1:44 - Orchestra and shamisen trade ideas.

2:09 - The start of a long and virtuosic cadenza-like passage for the shamisen.
Builds on the material presented earlier (particularly the rhythmic devices),
and also showcases idiomatic techniques like glissandi and pitch bends.

4:08 - The orchestra reenters here for a reprise of the A and B section
material.

### Movement II

This movement has a palindromic structure: from 4:10 onward, the textural
development is similar to what occurs from 0:00-2:56, but in reverse.
The middle section features steady repetition of short figures.

0:00 - High-pitched shakuhachi (?) introduces a meditative theme.

0:34 - A lower-pitched flute (again, shakuhachi?) introduces a second idea.

0:54 - Both instruments play their ideas together.

1:43 - Stringed orchestral instruments enter, and the shamisen comes in
shortly afterward.
They play what sounds like a version of the first theme but in metered time
(whereas the initial thematic presentation sounded freer).

2:56 - Atmosphere suddenly shifts from meditative to energetic.

3:12 - A section featuring repeated patterns.
Eventually dissolves into a brief period of silence.

4:10 - A return to the texture at 1:43.

4:45 - Shakuhachi (both high- and low-pitched) reenter, repeating the
texture from 0:54.

5:43 - High-pitched shakuhachi is left alone, playing the material
from the beginning of the movement.

### Movement III

0:00 - "A" section with the orchestra and shamisen playing together.
This is a brief thematic idea in triple meter.

0:13 - Shamisen takes the lead, playing a more virtuosic version of the
previous music.
Again, some interesting pitch-bend techniques can be heard here.

The shamisen continues to develop the ideas from the A section, with
the orchestra occasionally interjecting a clear restatement of the
original material to keep things grounded.

1:05 - Distinct textural shift. The meter becomes rather complex here
(it sounds like it's in 5), and the orchestral instruments get more involved.
This could be called a "B" section/texture.

2:03 - Returns to the "A" texture.

2:17 - Another textural and metric shift, sort of similar to the "B" texture,
with some interesting techniques audible in the orchestra.

2:33 - A virtuosic cadenza-like passage for the shamisen, again based around
short repeated figures.

2:59 - Return to the "A" section.

## Recordings

### Pro Musica Nipponia (2019)

Recording information \[[^5]\]:
- Shamisen: Nami Kineie (杵家七三)
- Conductor: Takuo Tamura (田村拓男)
- Label: Pro Musica Nipponia
- Reference number: PMN-004

See the embedded Spotify links above for audio.

While I don't have much to compare it against, this recording seems well done.
The players capture the energy of the piece, the soloist shines through in the
places where she should, and sections like the beginning and end of the second
movement feel free and meditative in a way that, from what I understand,
traditional shakuhachi music is often intended to sound.
