## Further information

For more information on Yoshimatsu, see the page about his
[Saxophone Concerto, "Cyber Bird"](./01-yoshimatsu-cyberbird.md).

The "Memo Flora" concerto was written as a "memorandum on flowers," according
to Yoshimatsu.
He describes a different image for each movement.
The first "celebrates flowers blooming quietly in a spring field against a
background of shifting colours."
The second depicts "flower petals floating on the water," and the finale
depicts "spring \[speeding\] away from the spring field, in full bloom."

The title refers to a notebook kept by poet Kenji Miyazawa, which contained
diagrams for arranging flowers in a flowerbed.
Yoshimatsu likens this to arranging a melody on a score.
He also notes that he wanted to write a "beautiful piano concerto" in the same
key and three-part form (fast-slow-fast) as Mozart's final piano concerto
(K. 595, in B-flat major) \[[^3]\].

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording by the Manchester Camerata with pianist
Kyoko Tabe (embedded below).

### I. Flower (0:00)

In his liner note, Yoshimatsu writes that this movement is in a "pseudo-sonata"
form.
The movement of recapitulation seems pretty obscured to me, but otherwise I've
added approximate sonata-form indications to the analysis below (where they
seem appropriate).

0:00 - The piece begins with the piano and orchestra slowly unfolding from silence.

1:36 - The first emergence of the "A" theme (primary theme equivalent).
Slowly solidifies into a clear presentation.

3:49 - A new, more energetic section. We'll call this the "B" theme.

4:24 - Back to slower material; sounds like an ornamented "A" theme.

5:01 - "A" theme returns.

5:15 - Slow, meditative section, a new theme ("C" - probably the best candidate
for a secondary theme equivalent).

5:58 - "A" theme taken up by the woodwinds.
Possibly the start of a development-like section?

7:00 - Sounds like a possible "C" theme modification.

7:30 - "A" theme, modulating.

7:44 - A new section with syncopated music and mixed meter.
Almost jazzy, in a way.

8:36 - Bursts back into the "A" theme, again with sequencing.

8:54 - Back to a version of the syncopated texture.

9:20 - Back to the sequencing "A" theme.

9:42 - Calms down to a very open presentation of the "C" theme at 9:50.

10:28 - Sounds like further development of the "C" theme.

11:24 - Returns to the "A" material, featuring a very active woodwind section.
This section builds steadily until a peak at 13:01, after which it unwinds
to the end of the movement.

14:17 - After a moment of silence, a sudden piano and brass flourish
marks the end of the movement.

### II. Petals (14:31)

14:31 - Theme presented and restated in the piano.
The orchestra interjects with lush harmonies.

15:22 - A more insistent statement of the theme in the piano.

15:48 - Piano meditates on the theme; sounds improvisatory.

17:16 - A bit of energy gain.
Leads into a textural section where the piano and some orchestral instruments
play short non-melodic figures back and forth.

18:24 - Theme returns (slightly fuller presentation, higher in pitch).

19:02 - Piano flourishes around a melody that sounds very similar to the
"C" theme from the first movement.
This is taken up by the violin soon afterward in a significant secondary solo,
then it goes back to the piano.

21:18 - A distinctly different section, with new melodic material and a faster,
consistent tempo.
The music gradually crescendos from here until 22:50.

23:08 - Restatement of the opening theme for this movement (14:31).

24:05 - A further modification of the first movement "C" theme, based on 19:02?

### III. Bloom (25:12)

25:12 - Movement begins with flourishes in the piano and orchestra.

25:24 - Piano presentation of the theme with orchestral background figures.
Note the strong mixed meter.

26:13 - Something new.

26:25 - Theme returns, this time in the orchestra.

26:50 - An embellished version of the theme in the piano,
followed by what sounds like more new material.

27:02 - Another embellished piano thematic statement.
Followed by a fairly straightforward thematic return in the orchestra.

27:40 - More creative thematic embellishment by the piano, again followed
by an orchestral statement.
This pattern of thematic variation continues for a while.

29:26 - A slow, lyrical reimagination of this movement's theme.

30:25 - Snaps back into the original tempo.
The rest of the movement consists of different interpretations of the theme.
