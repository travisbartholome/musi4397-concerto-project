# 吉松 隆 Yoshimatsu, Takashi - "Cyber Bird" Concerto, Op. 59

## Background information

Solo instruments: Alto saxophone, piano, percussion

Composed: Fall 1993 - Spring 1994

Important people: The piece was commissioned by saxophonist Nobuya Sugawa, to be played by him
along with pianist Minako Koyagi and percussionist Takako Yamaguchi \[[^1]\].

Premiere information: Premiered on Mar. 21, 1994, by the Yomiuri
Symphony Orchestra (conductor: Masahiko Enkoji) \[[^2]\].

Published by: ASKS Orchestra (<https://asks-orch.com/>).

Recording history: Nobuya Sugawa has recorded this concerto twice (TOCE-9152, CHAN-9737).
There don't appear to be any other significant recordings.

## Further information

Yoshimatsu has written quite a few concertos (10) for a variety of solo instruments,
so it seemed appropriate to include one on this list.
Outside of the concert hall, he's probably best known as the composer for
the 2003 remake of *Astro Boy* (a classic anime).
He's an interesting composer in the sense that his music is quite tonal, and his style is
heavily influenced by Western popular music - namely, jazz and rock.

The Cyber Bird Concerto, with its various jazz elements ranging from swing sections to
sections of free jazz imitation, illustrates these characteristics well.
The piece is also interesting because while it predominantly features the saxophone,
the piano and drumset/percussion are also afforded significant solo roles.
Yoshimatsu describes it as being "a kind of triple concerto" for these
three instruments \[[^3]\].

## Analysis

Timestamps are in reference to the 1999 recording by Nobuya Sugawa (linked below).

### I. Bird in Colors (0:00)

The form of this section appears loosely inspired by concerto-sonata form,
but it doesn't neatly follow the pattern one might expect.
Instead, the main theme is presented several times, each time in a different way,
usually separated by atmospheric interludes.

Yoshimatsu describes this movement as "a somewhat frenzied Allegro in which a bird
flies through strata of varying colours" - presumably, the saxophone is the bird,
and the orchestra, driven by the piano and drums, produce the changing colors.

The "A" theme presented in the saxophone and piano starts as follows:

![Incipit for the Cyber-bird Concerto, first movement.](../snippets/01-yoshimatsu-cyberbird/incipit-mvt1.png)

0:00 - Solo saxophone and piano present the "A" theme.

0:55 - "A" theme is replayed and developed by the saxophone, with drumset and
piano acting as a rhythm section.
Orchestral accompaniment is generally sparse.

1:46 - Strings reiterate "A" with saxophone silent, piano and drums as
background parts.

2:13 - Return of the saxophone/piano texture, playing "A" again but with added
special effects.

2:35 - "A" theme devolves into a sound-mass, heavy on ambient noise from
cymbals, strings, and saxophone.

3:00 - Lyrical "B" theme is introduced by the piano, with the saxophone
following later.

4:08 - "A" theme makes its return, woven on top of the lighter background
texture from the "B" section.

4:25 - Swing section begins, with the drumset and piano establishing the groove.
Solo flute plays the "A" theme in the new swing feel; saxophone joins later.

5:07 - "A" theme breaks down again, this time into a frantic texture with a
driving rhythm section, reminiscent of free jazz.

6:03 - Free jazz texture subsides into a more relaxed atmospheric texture
similar to 2:35.

6:20 - Saxophone enters with a loose, improvisatory variation on the "A" theme,
over plodding fifths in the piano (a sort of slow cadenza?).
The orchestra steadily crescendoes behind the saxophone until...

7:44 - Orchestral crescendo ends; soloists drop out, and the strings play
sustained chords and short, slow figures.

8:09 - Saxophone and piano return with the "A" theme, close to how it was
presented initially.

### II. Bird in Grief (8:48)

This movement consists of continual repetition and variation of a main theme.

8:48 - Piano presents mournful "A" material.

9:38 - Saxophone enters with lyrical, improvisatory "B" material, while the
piano continues playing its original material.

10:35 - Saxophone plays around the "A" material in an loosely improvisatory way.
Piano also continues with "A".

11:21 - Saxophone improvisation becomes more virtuosic.
String harmonies and accompaniment figures become more dense.

12:08 - Fragments of "A" in the piano, orchestral flute solo, and eventually
the saxophone.

13:13 - Saxophone plays the "A" melody again, plainly.
After the initial statement, the saxophone part gets more improvisatory again.

14:50 - Orchestra and saxophone quietly play the "A" material, then gradually
crescendo to a climax at 15:29, with an extremely delayed resolution in the
saxophone part.

16:05 - Piano returns to the "A" material. Plaintive.
Joined by the saxophone at 16:35 with some soft string harmony.
The movement ends this way; it's in major with rich extended harmony, but it
still sounds wistful.

### III. Bird in the Wind (17:11)

This movement roughly follows an ABCABC structure where the theme from the
first movement is brought back and supplemented with two new upbeat themes
that have similar syncopated feels.

17:11 - Saxophone enters with the upbeat "A" material from the first movement
(somewhat modified/developed).

18:12 - Saxophone plays a new "B" material (in the same quick tempo).

18:48 - Orchestral brass introduce syncopated "C" material.
(Saxophone solo is silent here.)

19:16 - Saxophone reenters with the "B" material.

19:29 - Lyrical line in the saxophone emerges out of the "B" material.

19:42 - Brass return with "C" material.
Eventually transforms into another sound-mass texture (like what happened
a couple of times in the first movement).

20:16 - Sound mass gives way to a cadenza-like passage for the saxophone
and drumset.
Those two solo instruments interplay, passing figures back and forth in a way
that sounds highly improvisatory (again, reminiscent of the conversational
nature of free jazz).

21:14 - Saxophone brings the "A" material back as the orchestra reenters.
Drumset plays a driving pulse.

21:42 - Strings bring back the "B" material, soon joined by the saxophone.

21:56 - Saxophone dissolves into expressive, free, wild figures.
Sounds extremely improvisatory.

22:50 - At the height of the saxophone's efforts, the orchestra reenters
underneath with the "C" material.
This leads to a dramatic flourish that finishes off the piece.

Sugawa's recordings (on two different CDs) seem to be the only published recordings of this piece.
Yoshimatsu and Sugawa have a fairly long history of collaboration that has produced several
excellent pieces for saxophone, so Sugawa seems to bring a uniquely authentic interpretation to
Yoshimatsu's works.
His sense for expression and somewhat unrestrained playing make the wilder parts of this concerto
feel really energetic; he also brings an appropriate sense of style to the jazz-influenced
sections of the piece, and again shows off his expressive sense during the lyrical moments.
(Needless to say, I like this recording a lot.)
