# 佐藤 聰明 Satoh, Somei - Violin Concerto

## Background information

Solo instrument: Violin

Composed: 2002

Important figures: Commissioned by the Suntory Music Foundation.

Premiere information: Premiered by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra
in 2002, with Anne Akiko Meyers on violin and Tetsuji Honna conducting \[[^1]\].

Published by: Zen-On Music Co., Ltd.

Recording history: Camerata released a recording of the piece in 2003
(CMCD-28032); this is likely a recording of the premiere, since it's live and
features the same personnel \[[^2]\].

## Further information

Satoh is largely a self-taught composer, having never had a formal music education.
He has done some traveling internationally by invitation, including a year-long
stay in New York, and he has also been involved in producing some multimedia
works in addition to concert pieces (especially early in his career), involving
things like laser/speaker displays spanning several mountains \[[^3]\]\[[^4]\].

Many people comment on Satoh's use of silence in music (e.g., \[[^5]\]\[[^6]\]).
This is certainly a prominent theme in his violin concerto, along with the use
of sustained pitches, which Satoh compares to silence: both are suspensions of
time, one with sound and one without.
The results are interesting, beautiful in a strangely delicate way, and (at
least according to Satoh) indicative of a distinctly Japanese perception of
time \[[^7]\].
This concerto is also interesting because the soloist doesn't really show off
technique, and the orchestra sometimes absorbs the soloist completely within
its own wave of sound.

## Analysis

This is a single-movement concerto.
Timestamps refer to the recording embedded below (CMCD-28032).

For me, this piece makes the most sense as a series of solo/orchestra swells,
separated by contemplative sections of silence or relatively sparse
lyrical/sustained material.

0:00 - Piece begins with a faint bass drum pulse.

0:15 - Solo violin enters with a lyrical line made of long sustained pitches.

1:20 - Violin drops out, leaving the drum alone again.

1:30 - Sustained orchestral instruments emerge from niente, starting a long
crescendo. Violin reenters with more lyrical/rhapsodic material.

3:08 - The crescendo swells to a peak in the orchestra, and the violin plays
some impassioned figures.

3:38 - Music fades to silence, again leaving just the faint bass drum pulse.

3:48 - Violin reenters with slow glissandi; percussion plays.
Clarinet solo at 4:10 with more sustained material.
This section is characterized by silence interspersed with solo instrumental
long tones, all over the drum pulse that has been there the whole time.

5:05 - The bass drum stops. Complete silence.

5:18 - Orchestral strings start to fade back in from niente.
Sustained harmonies, lushly tonal for a moment, then they fade.

6:08 - Solo oboe (or similar instrument) for a moment, similar to the texture
from 3:48.

6:32 - Orchestral swell. Fades at 7:10.

7:10 - Another section of silence.

7:30 - Rich, somewhat quiet low brass chords, followed by bass clarinet.
Exploring the low end of the orchestra, fading in and out of silence again.

8:14 - Silence again.

8:30 - Solo violin reenters with a lyrical line.
Feels similar to the beginning of the piece.
Line becomes more rhapsodic as this section progresses, eventually including
some double-stops and high harmonics (still in a very lyrical context).

10:30 - A moment of silence, followed by more violin lyricism and an orchestral
reentry and slow crescendo from niente.
Similar to 1:30.

12:05-12:30 - Orchestra and violin peak again (similar to 3:08).

12:35 - A sudden chime strike, in the middle of a long section of silence,
marks the middle of the piece.

13:10 - Sound enters again (tentatively), led by the flute.
More sustained material here that fades in and out of near-silence.

14:52 - Solo violin again (long glissandi, silence, then sustained lyrical
material).

15:40 - A few orchestral figures, almost an interjection, but it emerges
naturally from the space in the violin line.
Otherwise, still a solo violin section.

17:03 - Another long section of near-silence, with only very quiet sustained
string bass and a bell-like percussion note of some sort.

17:42-20:20 - Another long, swelling section similar to 1:30-3:38,
followed by silence.

20:54 - Solo violin again, effectively over silence.

21:25 - The bass drum pulse begins again (absent, as far as I can hear, since
it went silent at 5:05 - arguably, other low-pitched instruments took its
place in future sections).

22:42-23:43 - One last swell in the solo and orchestra, but much smaller this time.

23:43 - Solo violin sustained pitches and glissandi over the bass drum pulse.
Very similar to the beginning of the piece.
After the violin stops, the bass drum gradually slows down and stops,
leaving only silence for a while.

The orchestra in this recording really captures the fragility of the music;
most of the textures have only a few instruments that are all playing softly,
and they do a good job of fading in and out smoothly.
The swells are carefully paced, and Meyers also captures the free/meditative
nature of the solo part well.
