## Background information

Solo instrument: viola

Composed: 1989

Important figures (besides the commissioning group and premiere artists, discussed later):
The title of the work comes from a poem by Japanese poet Makoto Ooka \[[^1]\].

Premiere information: The piece was premiered by violist Nobuko Imai and the
Orchestre de Paris, with Kent Nagano conducting \[[^2]\].

Published by: Schott Music Co. Ltd., Tokyo

Recording history: The earliest recording appears to be a 1991 CD
by the Saito Kinen Orchestra, conducted by Seiji Ozawa with Nobuko Imai as the soloist
and published by Philips Digital Classics (PHCP-160) \[[^3]\].
This version appears to have been reissued by Decca in 2015.
Other recordings include one from 2002 by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales
(soloist: Philip Dukes, reference: BIS-CD-1300) and a 2017 CD by the Japan
Philharmonic (soloist: Kazuki Yamada, reference: OVCL-00644).

## Further information

Takemitsu is probably one of the most well-known Japanese composers in America.
He wrote many pieces that could be considered concertos (i.e., they feature
some solo instrument(s) with an orchestra), of which *A String Around Autumn*
is probably one of the best known.

This work was composed by commission for the 1989 Festival d’Automne à Paris,
which commemorated the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
Since it was written for a French commissioning group, Takemitsu wrote a work
that illustrated his French influences (composers like Debussy and Messiaen),
which makes this an interesting work to show how those influences
affected his compositions.
The work is also quite representative of Takemitsu's orchestral style in general;
the music is pan-tonal and has an ethereal quality to it that evokes
some sense of abstract beauty and rich, colorful sound, as do many of his other works.
Takemitsu described this particular piece as an "imaginary landscape"
depicting an autumn scene \[[^4]\].

A side note: Takemitsu also often included traditional Japanese instruments
in his works, either as members of the orchestra or sometimes as a soloist.
However, this work doesn't include that feature of his style.

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording by the Saito Kinen Orchestra, with violist
Nobuko Imai (embedded below).

Most of the melodic material in this piece appears to be based off of the same
basic figure, so the interest largely comes from changes in the
orchestration and harmony.
One of the most consistent and interesting features is the way that Takemitsu
takes dissonant, rough textures and turns them into lush harmonies and lyrical
lines, with seemingly no need for transition - it's as if the dissonance
just evaporates, leaving consonance behind.

0:00 - Initial orchestral sound is established.
Some interesting moments where dissonance suddenly breaks through into rich,
consonant harmonies.

0:38 - Viola entry.
Somewhat dissonant at first, then the end of the first phrase dissolves into
consonance, and the second phrase is backed by rich harmonies in the orchestra.

2:10 - Viola plays over sustained low pitches for a short while.

2:30 - Strings reenter. Some interesting figures in the flute (flutter-tongued),
clarinet, and harp provide textural variety.

3:33 - A very lyrical, harmonious line in the viola.
It's taken up by various woodwinds.

4:52 - A somewhat aggressive-sounding orchestra texture that once again
evaporates into lush harmonies and a viola melody.

6:15 - A very French-sounding moment here (inspiration from Debussy, perhaps?).

8:25 - A dramatic moment of dissonance, made more effective by some extended
techniques in the strings.

9:06 - Melancholy-sounding viola entry; the strings are still producing a somewhat
unsettling background texture.

9:48 - The "unsettling" string texture gradually morphs into a more consonant
one, with interesting in-between states where the two textures mix.

12:34 - A cadenza-like moment for the viola (orchestral accompaniment drops out).
Not particularly virtuosic, but it definitely has an impassioned, improvised
character.

13:55 - Orchestra reenters. Lush, consonant harmony again, with viola melody.
This continues (with a few short moments where dissonance returns) until the
end of the piece.

## Recordings

### Saito Kinen Orchestra (1991)

Recording information \[[^5]\]:
- Viola: Nobuko Imai
- Conductor: Seiji Ozawa
- Label: Philips Digital Classics
- Reference number: PHCP-160

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Us4CygxP7pI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This recording takes its time with the music; in particular, Imai takes fairly
relaxed tempos in the free parts of the music and seems very willing
to let the viola lines stretch out or "breathe" a bit.
The orchestra also noticeably lingers in the consonant sections, which makes
them very effective as resting places/arrivals from the dissonant areas that
precede them.

### Japan Philharmonic (2017)

Recording information \[[^6]\]:
- Viola: Tomoko Akasaka \[[^7]\]
- Conductor: Kazuki Yamada
- Label: Exton
- Reference number: OVCL-00644

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/os5kL3KNmb4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This recording feels quicker overall than the Saito Kinen recording (even
though the overall runtime is fairly similar).
As a result, it feels a little rushed by comparison; however, some of the
phrasing does seem to come through a bit more easily at the quicker pace.
