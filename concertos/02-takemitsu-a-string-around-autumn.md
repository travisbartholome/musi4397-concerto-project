## Significance

Takemitsu is probably one of the most well-known Japanese composers in America.
He wrote many pieces that could be considered concertos (i.e., they feature
some solo instrument(s) with an orchestra), of which *A String of Autumn* seems
to be one of the best known.

This work was composed by commission for the 1989 Festival d’Automne à Paris,
which commemorated the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
Since it was written for a French commissioning group, Takemitsu wrote a work
that illustrated his French influences (composers like Debussy and Messiaen),
which makes this an interesting work to show how those influences
affected his compositions.
The work is also quite representative of Takemitsu's orchestral style in general;
the music is pan-tonal and has an ethereal quality to it that evokes
some sense of abstract beauty and rich, colorful sound, as do many of his other works.
Takemitsu described this particular piece as an "imaginary landscape"
depicting an autumn scene \[[^4]\].

A side note: Takemitsu also often included traditional Japanese instruments
in his works, either as members of the orchestra or sometimes as a soloist.
However, this work doesn't include that feature of his style.
