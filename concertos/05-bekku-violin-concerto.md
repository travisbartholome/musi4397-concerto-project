# 別宮 貞雄 Bekku, Sadao - Violin Concerto

## Background information

Solo instrument: Violin

Composed: 1969

Published by: Zen-On Music Co., Ltd. \[[^1]\]

Recording history: Released on a 2002 CD from Sony Classical (SICC-48) \[[^2]\]
and a 2014 CD from Naxos Japan (NYNN-0033) that was recorded in 1969, (possibly
the premiere recording?) \[[^3]\].

Premiere and commission information: unable to find.

## Further information

Bekku initially learned composition as a hobby and graduated from the
University of Tokyo with a physics degree, intending to make that his
profession.
However, he got more into composition and eventually went to Paris and
studied with Milhaud and Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire from 1951-54.
His concert works include four symphonies, three concertos (violin, viola,
and cello), three operas, and some art songs (including the popular
"Sakura Yokocho," or "Cherry Blossom Lane").

Bekku's musical taste was less avant-garde than some of his contemporaries;
he explores chromaticism thoroughly but is not a twelve-tone composer, and
he priorities a sense of lyricism/melody in his music.
The violin concerto reflects these attitudes: while the tonality gets pretty
thorny at times, the piece never loses its sense of melody \[[^4]\].

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the NHK Symphony recording linked below (NYNN-0033).

This piece frequently uses a sectional style of thematic development where
a theme/melodic idea is introduced by some instrument (either the solo violin
or a secondary soloist in the orchestra), then passed around throughout various
instruments and developed for a while until a new section begins.

0:00 - The work begins with a chromatic lyrical section for the solo violin
(with the orchestra playing accompaniment material).

1:22 - Switches to a more lively texture with virtuosic solo violin technique.

1:38 - Violin drops out. Orchestral section with a lot of short phrases from
secondary soloists, then a long, lyrical oboe solo at 2:35.

3:08 - Solo violin takes up the melody from the oboe.
Orchestra continues playing background material.

3:43 - Solo violin switches to playing background figures briefly
as woodwind soloists take over the melody.

4:12 - A new section with a new melody.
The violin shifts in and out of a dominant position for a while;
melodic figures are passed between the violin and orchestral soloists.
It doesn't sound like the two forces are vying for control; instead, they seem
to share it.

5:21 - A dramatic section led by the solo violin in pseudo-cadenza style,
with some background parts in the orchestra (mostly sustained pitches
while the violin plays).

5:52 - Orchestral interlude, featuring a melodic motif made of repeated notes
moving upward.
The solo violin comes in shortly afterward and trades this line back and forth
with the orchestra.

6:48 - A more lively melodic section, mostly led by the solo violin.
At 7:23 the orchestral strings start to play melodic figures as well, while
the violin recedes a bit, once again creating a sound that is more collaborative
than solo-dominated.

7:59 - A dramatic texture shift brought on by the brass, followed by another
melody that is introduced in the solo violin and then passed around the
ensemble.

8:57 - A new melodic fragment appears in the clarinet, is passed around the
woodwinds, and is then taken up and developed further by the solo violin.
As we've seen before, the violin's development soon turns into a possible
background part as the orchestral winds continue to play the melodic fragment.

10:06 - A new melodic fragment from the clarinets, which is taken up by the
solo violin and developed; this time, the development progresses a bit further,
the solo part becomes pretty technical, and the orchestral background is a bit
more complex.

11:30 - Another dramatic cadenza-like section for the solo violin (again with
some static background pitches in the orchestra).
Followed by equally dramatic material in the orchestra, until...

12:03 - Sudden shift in mood; the orchestra drops to piano, and the violin
reenters with a melancholy lyrical passage.

13:07 - A true solo cadenza (no orchestral background), for quite a long time.
Features a lot double-stops and sequencing, mostly in a rhapsodic lyrical style
(i.e., dramatic and in somewhat free rhythm).

15:41 - Orchestra reenters slowly, as the violin cadenza winds down into a
slow melody.

16:15 - A new section. Solo violin introduces a staccato theme which is soon
taken up by the orchestra.
The same sort of development pattern that was used earlier occurs again here.

18:26 - A new section. Solo introduces a lyrical theme, the orchestral
woodwinds gradually join it, and the ensemble plays around with the theme
for a while.

19:55 - Returns to the theme and style from 16:15.
Lively, and especially virtuosic in the solo part.
The manipulation of this theme lasts until the piece comes to a dramatic finish.

My favorite part of this recording is probably the lyrical style that everyone
in the ensemble uses - not just the soloist, but also the orchestra as well
(particularly the secondary soloists when applicable).
Technically speaking, it also sounds quite clean, although there are a few
noticeable oddities as one might expect from an early performance of the piece
(I'm not sure if this was recorded live or not).

### Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra (2002)

I wasn't able to find freely available full audio for this recording, but it
seemed good to put the basic information here anyway.
