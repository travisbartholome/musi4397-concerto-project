## Further information

For more information on Takemitsu, see the page for
[*A String Around Autumn*](./02-takemitsu-a-string-around-autumn.md).

*I Hear the Water Dreaming* was inspired by an aboriginal painting titled
"Water Dreaming" that Takemitsu saw during a visit to Australia.
The painting made references to a piece of aboriginal mythology called
"dreamtime" (also the title of another Takemitsu work), a period before creation.
Several of Takemitsu's works feature themes related to water and dreams, so
this concerto ties in excellently.
Here, he uses delicate shifts in orchestration to produce different textures,
overall creating music with an ephemeral, "dreamlike" sense.
It also features some interesting timbre trills in the solo flute part \[[^3]\]\[[^4]\].

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording by the Munich Radio Orchestra with soloist
Emmanuel Pahud (embedded below).

0:00 - Orchestra establishes a starting texture.

0:18 - Flute entry, with a theme that grounds the piece ("the theme").
This theme is centered around the pitch A-flat.

0:43 - Orchestra section (with orchestral flute?).
The theme is not obviously present, but the music here does also center
around A-flat.

1:05 - Flute reentry, again playing the theme.
More development around the theme this time.

1:58 - Possibly a new idea in the flute.
Some interesting extended techniques here as well.

2:45 - Orchestral texture shifts from string-centric to brass-centric.
Flute plays with the theme again.

3:09 - Clear thematic restatement, down a half step.

4:00 - Orchestration becomes fuller, with strings and brass.
The orchestral woodwinds are also starting to become more present.

5:00 - Lush section of music for strings only.

5:23 - Flute reentry with a modified version of the theme, with strings
and light percussion.

6:16 - Another interesting texture shift in the orchestra - woodwinds,
strings, and brass are all active here, the solo flute merges with the
orchestral oboe a bit, and the harmonies get a little more dissonant.

7:16 - Solo flute (orchestra drops out). Material is still rooted in the theme.
Orchestra is led back in at 7:35 by the bassoon.

7:50 - Interesting string-slapping textures in the orchestra, pitch bends in
the flute.

9:32 - Orchestra shifts to mostly sustained pitches underneath the flute solo
(still playing the theme).
The piece ends this way.

## Selected Recordings

### Munich Radio Orchestra (2019)

Recording information \[[^5]\]:
- Flute: Emmanuel Pahud
- Conductor: Ivan Repušić

This recording stands out to me for the delicacy with which the orchestra
and soloist treat the music.
Pahud's style here is smooth with few jarring moments; the orchestra matches
this lightness and comes and goes gradually, producing slow shifts in the music
that give the listener a sense of its "dreamlike" quality.

### BBC Symphony Orchestra (2000)

Recording information \[[^6]\]:
- Flute: Patrick Gallois
- Conductor: Andrew Davis
- Label: Deutsche Grammophon
- Reference number: 00028945345925

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwE9MELOjgY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In comparison to the Munich Radio Orchestra recording, this interpretation of
the piece seems quite a bit more aggressive.
The performers are free with time, which in some cases means they speed up
quite a lot during phrases; Gallois, the soloist, also seems to have a more
aggressive articulation and phrasing style than Pahud does.
The end result sounds very dynamic but loses a bit of the dreamy atmosphere.
