# 矢代 秋雄 Yashiro, Akio - Piano Concerto

## Background information

Solo instrument: Piano

Composed: 1964-67

Important figures: Commissioned by the NHK (Japan's national broadcasting corporation).

Premiere information: Premiered by the NHK Symphony Orchestra in 1967
(broadcast performance) with piano soloist Hiroko Nakamura and conductor
Hiroshi Wakasugi \[[^1]\].

Published by: Ongaku no Tomo Sha Corp.

Recording history: The live premiere (different from the broadcast premiere)
of the piece at the Tokyo Cultural Center in 1968 was recorded; this recording
was re-released on CD by Naxos Japan in 2011 (NYNG-002), commemorating the
35th anniversary of Yashiro's death \[[^2]\].
The concerto was also recorded by the Ulster Orchestra for a CD released
by Naxos in 2002 (8.555351).

## Further information

Yashiro studied at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music (now
Tokyo University of the Arts), and after graduating in 1951 he moved to France
and studied at the Paris Conservatoire, eventually returning to Japan in 1956.
He was known as a composer of music for documentaries and drama, and he composed
only a handful of concert works including this one (he also wrote a cello concerto!).
He was also an important mentor to the next generation of composers to emerge
from his university in Tokyo, which included Shin-ichiro Ikebe, Akira Nishimura,
and others.

Yashiro's piano concerto is popular among works by Japanese composers, and it was
very well-received after its premiere.
It reflects the influence of Yashiro's French education, and it sounds modern
while still being fairly understandable.
The concerto is in a typical format, with a sonata-form first movement, a slow
second movement, and a rondo-form finale \[[^3]\].

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording linked below by the Ulster
Orchestra (Naxos 8.555351).

### Allegro animato (i) (0:00)

As mentioned before, this movement is in a typical sonata form, albeit
one with a short development section.

0:00 - Primary (P) theme.

0:48 - Beginning of the P theme repeats.

1:22 - A weird and vaguely jazzy interruption that seems to function as a
sort of transition.
The CD liner notes call this a "quasi-cadenza" for the piano, but it's worth
noting that the orchestra also comes in fairly soon (1:42).

3:05 - Piano rolls background chords; flute introduces the secondary (S) theme,
which is lyrical as expected (and a bit melancholy, in this case).
Oboe takes over the S theme at 4:09, then flute and bassoon take it back.

4:36 - Another pseudo-cadenza moment for the piano. Lots of trills.

5:08 - Piano plays the S theme, no orchestra besides sparse percussion at first.

6:02 - Likely the beginning of the (short) development.
Orchestra reenters with a lyrical theme (doesn't seem derived from the S
theme) while the piano plays chords that seem similar to the P theme.

7:00 - Extremely virtuosic, cadenza-like moment in the piano.

7:35 - More development.
The primary theme is reorchestrated so that it's distributed throughout
the orchestra, but it's still recognizable.

8:22 - Recapitulation of the P theme.
Gets a more dramatic treatment and a much fuller orchestration here.

10:04 - Recapitulation of the S theme (again in the flute, with no rolled piano
chords this time).
Taken up soon after by the piano (10:16).

10:58 - Probably could call this a coda?
P and S material alternate in short bursts.
The piano has the P theme, while the woodwinds (solo flute, oboe, and
clarinet in the orchestra) have the S theme.

### Adagio misterioso (ii) (12:23)

This movement features a constant rhythmic figure that repeats the note C.
This figure is present throughout the entire movement, passed around to
various instruments.

12:23 - Movement begins with middle C repeated in the piano.

13:09 - Strings begin to sneak in behind the piano, with slow melodic material.

14:16 - Piano begins to play chords.
The repeated C moves to the timpani and trumpet.

15:12 - Piano goes silent, and the strings play again.

15:32 - Piano reenters with the repeated C (along with flute), now an octave higher.

16:00 - Rippling arpeggio figures in the piano, over lyrical strings.
Evolves into more dissonant and jarring piano material, sounds rhapsodic.
The orchestra also gets more aggressive.

17:25 - Arrives at the climax of this section.
Piano plods through on low Cs, while the orchestra plays some dramatic
lyrical material.

18:29 - The climactic section ends.
Returns to a sparse texture where the repeated C is dominant, essentially
identical to 13:09, except this time the strings are fading out instead
of fading in.

19:22 - Back to the solo piano with repeated middle C.
So the movement ends like it began, but in reverse.

### Allegro - Andante - Vivace molto capriccioso (iii) (19:51)

This movement appears to be in 5-part rondo form with a coda.

19:51 - Movement begins with the rondo theme, which consists of aggressive
string figures split by quiet brass.
Only orchestra here.

20:32 - Solo piano plays a technical/aggressive/dissonant first episode
with a few distinct styles.
Only solo piano throughout this section.
Some of this material is similar to the P theme from the first movement.

22:04 - Orchestra returns with the rondo theme, this time with a much more
dramatic orchestration.
Seems like the quiet brass part from the first presentation of the theme
has been made loud and superimposed on top of the string part.

22:27 - Piano reenters with a second episode that sounds like a more virtuosic
modification of the first (or at least, some material is definitely reused).
Notably, the orchestra plays background figures in this episode.

22:54 - Orchestra interjects with the main theme as the piano keeps playing.

24:30 - A slow interlude; the brass play their quiet section from the rondo
theme, while the piano quotes the P theme as presented at the beginning of
the first movement.

24:47 - Third return of the rondo theme.

25:18 - Begins a virtuosic coda, largely dominated by the piano in a style
similar to the piano episodes before this.
Coda speeds up at the end for a dramatic conclusion.

## Recordings

### Ulster Orchestra (2002)

Recording information \[[^4]\]:
- Piano: Hiromi Okada
- Conductor: Takuo Yuasa
- Label: Naxos
- Reference number: 8.555351

This recording is very clean.
At times it can sound a bit clinical (particularly in the first movement),
but generally the orchestra and piano do a great job of bringing out the
drama inherent to the piece.
They also take slightly faster tempos overall than the NHK recording, which
makes for an exciting presentation in the outer movements (especially in the
third movement).

### NHK Symphony Orchestra (1968 live premiere, released in 2011)

Recording information \[[^5]\]:
- Piano: Hiroko Nakamura
- Conductor: Tadashi Mori
- Label: Naxos Japan
- Reference number: NYNG-002

Available on Naxos: <https://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=NYNG-002>.

This recording feels a bit freer with tempo, and the entire group does a
fantastic job of bringing out contrasts (dynamics, tempo, etc.).
That said, the playing seems messier than the playing on the Ulster
Orchestra recording (which makes some sense given that this is a live
recording and also a premiere).
