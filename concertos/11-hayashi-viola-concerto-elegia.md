# 林 光 Hayashi, Hikaru - Viola Concerto, "Elegia"

## Background information

Solo instrument: Viola

Composed: 1995

Important figures: Commissioned by the Mito Chamber Orchestra;
dedicated to Nobuko Imai \[[^1]\].

Published by: Zen-On Music Co., Ltd. \[[^2]\]

a 2006 CD released by Pan Classics (PC10195) and once on a 2008 CD with the
Moscow Soloists released by Onyx (ONYX4027 or ON4027).

## Further information

Hayashi studied at the Tokyo University of Arts and is an active composer
in a wide variety of genres, including opera, orchestral works, choral works,
and film scores.
His style has been compared to that Eastern European and Russian composers
of the early- to mid-20th century, such as Bartók and Janáček \[[^3]\].

This concerto, written at the same time as some significantly different works
(e.g., the concertos from Yoshimatsu) shows the diversity of musical styles
that Japanese composers were using in the 1990s.
It has some lyrical melodies but also makes heavy use of repetition at times,
and the music can sound somewhat stark overall.
Interplay between the solo and orchestra is also key here, as they tend to
trade figures back and forth.

## Analysis

(Full analysis foregone in the interest of time - I had left this piece until the end.)

The soloist here does a good job of capturing the lyricism of the solo lines
(even when they happen to be a bit repetitive), giving the performancea sense
of direction that it would otherwise lack.
The orchestra plays cleanly and generally balances well underneath the viola
as appropriate.
