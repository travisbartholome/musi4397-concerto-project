## Significance

Ikebe is a prolific composer in multiple contexts: in addition to dozens of concert
works, he's written film scores and incidental music.
He serves as a composition professor at the Tokyo College of Music and as the
director of a few music organizations in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama \[[^2]\]-\[[^3]\].

I've included this concerto as an interesting sample of Ikebe's output.
It's one of his most recent works for large ensemble.
Although I don't know enough of his work to make generalizations,
when compared to some of Ikebe's older compositions that I listened to,
this piece seems noticeably tuneful/melody-driven.
(By contrast, his 1974 organ concerto, "Dimorphism," seems driven by a search
for unique combinations of sound masses - also an interesting piece.)
