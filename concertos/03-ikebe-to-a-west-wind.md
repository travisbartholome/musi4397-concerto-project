## Significance

Ikebe is a prolific composer in multiple contexts: in addition to dozens of concert
works, he's written film scores and incidental music.
He serves as a composition professor at the Tokyo College of Music and as the
director of a few music organizations in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama \[[^2]\]-\[[^3]\].

I've included this concerto as an interesting sample of Ikebe's output.
It's one of his most recent works for large ensemble.
Although I don't know enough of his work to make generalizations,
when compared to some of Ikebe's older compositions that I listened to,
this piece seems noticeably tuneful/melody-driven.
(By contrast, his 1974 organ concerto, "Dimorphism," seems driven by a search
for unique combinations of sound masses - also an interesting piece.)

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording linked below (CMCD-99083～4).

Note that this concerto is in three unnamed movements (TODO: provide timestamps for movements).

### Mvt. 1

- 0:00 | Orchestral opening, with a simple melody in the oboe
- 0:24 | Solo piano states its first theme
- 0:27 | Orchestra returns with its opening theme (now in bassoon). Some slight development
- 0:40 | Solo piano restates its theme and develops it slightly as well
- 0:51 | Piano and orchestra play together, each seeming to develop on their own thematic ideas
- 1:06 | Solo piano chordal interlude
- 1:12 | Piano and orchestra together again; piano takes the orchestra's opening theme. Piano rhythm speeds up and morphs into repeated patterns
- 1:39 | Thematic return?
- 1:45 | Piano variation on the opening orchestral theme (bass line), with large intervals and dense rhythms

TODO - finish analysis of this and remaining movements
