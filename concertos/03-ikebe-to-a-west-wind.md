## Further information

Ikebe is a prolific composer in multiple contexts: in addition to dozens of concert
works, he's written film scores and incidental music.
He serves as a composition professor at the Tokyo College of Music and as the
director of a few music organizations in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama \[[^2]\]-\[[^3]\].

I've included this concerto as an interesting sample of Ikebe's output.
It's one of his most recent works for large ensemble.
Although I don't know enough of his work to make generalizations,
when compared to some of Ikebe's older compositions that I listened to,
this piece seems noticeably tuneful/melody-driven.
(By contrast, his 1974 organ concerto, "Dimorphism," seems driven by a search
for unique combinations of sound masses - also an interesting piece.)

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording linked below (CMCD-99083～4).

Note that this concerto is in three unnamed movements; I've put the timestamps
in the heading for each movement.

### Mvt. 1 (0:00)

0:00 - Orchestral opening, with a simple melody in the oboe ("A" theme).

0:24 - Solo piano states its first theme ("B" theme).

0:27 - Orchestra returns with its opening theme ("A," now in the bassoon).
Some slight development.

0:40 - Solo piano restates its theme ("B") and develops it slightly as well.

0:51 - Piano and orchestra play together, each seeming to develop on their own
thematic ideas.
The staccato accompaniment brought up by the orchestra here becomes a fixture
for the rest of the movement.

1:06 - Solo piano chordal interlude.

1:12 - Piano and orchestra together again; piano takes the A theme instead of
the orchestra.
Piano rhythm eventually speeds up and morphs into repeated patterns.

1:45 - Piano variation on the B theme.

2:01 - Piano variation on the A theme.

2:23 - Piano variation combining both themes.
Some trading back and forth with the orchestra.

2:52 - Solo piano interlude (cadenza?).
Some fragments of the A theme are audible.

3:35 - Orchestra reenters. Piano restates the A theme, then the B theme,
and both the piano and orchestra switch back and forth between them.
Sounds loosely like a recapitulation.

4:58 - One last statement of the A theme in the piano.

### Mvt. 2 (5:12)

This movment is short and consists of two main sections.

5:12 - Solo piano plays free, rhapsodic lines, occasionally broken up by a
sforzando string entrance followed by a downward glissando.

6:26 - Lyrical figures in the strings (rhythmic unison), which the piano plays
alongside.
Here, the piano is essentially acting as a member of the string section, just
with a different tone.

### Mvt. 3 (7:38)

7:38 - Orchestra begins the movement with a fiery staccato texture.

7:52 - The piano takes up this texture as the orchestra drops out.
At 7:59, the theme for this movement is stated clearly in the piano.

From here, the orchestra and piano trade off material based around
this theme in the same staccato style.
Gradually, the trading starts to happen in progressively smaller chunks.

8:58 - At this point, the piano and orchestra parts play simultaneously,
although they have different cross-rhythms which creates a dense syncopated
texture (somewhat like hocketing, but I think there are moments where the
orchestra and piano play on the same beat).

9:22 - A sudden texture shift, leading to a solo piano section (cadenza?).
The piano brings back the A theme from the first movement and merges it with
the staccato theme from the third movement (see 7:59).

10:10 - Orchestra reenters; orchestra and piano play the third-movement
theme until the end.

This performance feels clean but not dull.
The pianist and orchestra bring out the themes where appropriate in a way that
makes the thematic manipulations that are going on easier to hear.
The dynamic contrast in this recording feels a bit compressed; I'm not sure if
that's because of the recording, the music itself, the performance, or the fact
that I'm listening to it on YouTube.
