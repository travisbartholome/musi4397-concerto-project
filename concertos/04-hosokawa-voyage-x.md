## Further information

For more information about Hosokawa, see the page about his
[Horn Concerto, "Moment of Blossoming"](./07-hosokawa-moment-of-blossoming.md).

*Voyage X* is the tenth work in a larger series of *Voyages* concertos that
Hosokawa has written for different solo instruments.
This one is written for shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese end-blown flute.
Shakuhachi music is traditionally meditative and not focused on large-scale
compositional ideas; rather, the focus is on the sound of the instrument.

The piece was premiered at the Leipzig Bach Festival, which also influenced
Hosokawa's choice of solo instrument.
According to him, shakuhachi is similar to Bach, but on the opposite end
of the sonic spectrum: while Bach creates complex architectures using
counterpoint, with shakuhachi, "the complete sound of the cosmos can
already be heard in a single tone" \[[^3]\].

## Analysis

Timestamps refer to the recording from WER6860-2 (available on Naxos).

0:00 - The piece begins with a meditative solo section for the shakuhachi.

1:45 - Ensemble enters briefly, adding somewhat rough-sounding low notes
underneath the shakuhachi.
Solo then continues.

2:45 - Strings reenter.

3:10 - Strings and shakuhachi create swells of sound as a group.

3:31 - Possibly a multiphonic technique in the shakuhachi? Hard to tell.
At any rate, plenty of interesting techniques being used here.

5:30 - Orchestral parts become more involved/frantic, eventually dying back
down at around 5:55.

6:20 - Orchestra starts to become overpowering again.
Leads to an orchestra-only section from 6:45 to 8:07.

7:10 - Metric shift: for a moment, the music is distinctly in-time.

8:07 - Shakuhachi reenters out of silence.

The texture here is similar to before: the shakuhachi plays meditative
material while the orchestra plays interesting figures underneath that
add to the atmosphere, occasionally lining up with the shakuhachi and
sometimes even overpowering it.

This pattern continues for the rest of the piece.

## Recordings

### Ensemble Musikfabrik (2015, recorded in 2009)

Recording information \[[^4]\]:
- Shakuhachi: Tadashi Tajima
- Conductor: Ilan Volkov
- Label: Wergo
- Reference number: WER6860-2

I couldn't find an embeddable recording of this piece, but it **is** available
on Naxos.

The shakuhachi playing on this recording is really impressive to listen to.
The soloist incorporates a staggering array of different sounds while sounding
completely natural.
The orchestra also does a great job handling the unusual techniques in their
parts, from string bounces to flutter-tonguing.
Overall, the amount of variety in this piece is one of the things that makes it
remain interesting, and this recording showcases that well.
