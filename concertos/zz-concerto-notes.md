## Hosokawa

Also note that Hosokawa actually seems to have a ton of concertos,
they just aren't published under the name "concerto."
Example CD to look at: NEOS10716 (on Naxos, has booklet).
There are probably others as well.
He has a guitar concerto, apparently.
Could also search "hosokawa concerto" on naxos.
The entire "Voyage" series (at least 6) are concertos.
