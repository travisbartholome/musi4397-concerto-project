## Background information

Important figures: Commissioned by the Japan Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra
for their principal trombonist, Yoshiki Hakoyama.

Premiere information: Premiered in 1993 by the Japan Philharmonic, with

Recording history: The piece appears to have been recorded twice.
The first was on Camerata (CMCD-50020) with the Japan Philharmonic and
trombonist Yoshiki Hakoyama (recorded live in 1993, released in 2009 - possibly
a premiere recording?) \[[^2]\]\[[^3]\].
The second was on Chandos (CHAN 9960) with the BBC Philharmonic and trombonist
Ian Bousfield, released in 2001 \[[^4]\].

## Further information

For more information about Yoshimatsu, see the page about his
[Saxophone Concerto, "Cyber Bird"](./01-yoshimatsu-cyberbird.md).

The "Orion Machine" concerto is in five movements, each of which represents
a star (or group of stars) in the constellation Orion.
Yoshimatsu describes the five movements as follows (paraphrased) \[[^5]\]:

- I. Betelgeuse: Begins with "a great explosion of stellar light," then is a typical Largo.
- II. Bellatrix: A fast jazzy movement in 5/8 with driving pulse.
- III. Trapezium: A "dirge and broken waltz" at 42 BPM (representing the M42 galaxy).
- IV. Saiph: A trombone cadenza, the back half of which is entirely improvised.
- V. Rigel: Begins as a brass fanfare, then builds to a consonant ending.

Yoshimatsu's jazz influences are particularly on display here, given the
outright big-band style of the second movement and the improvisation in the
fourth movement.

## Analysis

(Full analysis foregone in the interest of time - I had left this piece until the end.)

Definitely worth clicking to 15:40 for the surprise improvised cadenza quote of
the year, though.

Movement timestamps in the BBC recording:

- I. Betelgeuse: 0:00
- II. Bellatrix: 5:55
- III. Trapezium: 9:55
- IV. Saiph: 12:44
- V. Rigel: 19:15
