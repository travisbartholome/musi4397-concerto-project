Published by: Ricordi Berlin

Recording history: This piece has been recorded once, live (presumably the
premiere) with the Geigeki Wind Orchestra Academy and the Tokyo Kosei Wind
Orchestra, with tubist Øystein Baadsvik and conductor Shizuo Kuwahara \[[^3]\].

## Further information

Fujikura was raised in Japan and moved to the United Kingdom in his mid-teens.
He currently serves as composer-in-residence with the Nagoya Philharmonic
(in Nagoya, Japan) \[[^4]\].

Fujikura writes that his compositional process for this piece (and his other
concertos) revolved heavily around collaboration with the premiere performer.
In this case, he wanted to know what was the most appealing or exciting about
the tuba as an instrument.
Evidently he concluded that "the tuba is by far one of the sexiest instruments,"
so naturally (given that conclusion) this concerto has long, emotional melody
lines that mingle with the orchestra parts \[[^5]\].

I wanted to include this piece because it's a new piece by a relatively young
composer, and it's written for an instrument that historically doesn't get
much repertoire like this.
It also has more of a modernist feel to it than a lot of the other concertos
I've included in this project.

## Analysis

This concerto uses a fairly sparse orchestral texture most of the time, which
interjects figures underneath the long tuba melody lines.
These orchestral interjections can be quite interesting, using techniques
like flutter-tonguing and various brass mute manipulations.
A lot of the concerto also **sounds** like it's in relatively free time.
Towards the end, Fujikura starts using a lighter staccato texture instead of
the freer texture that characterizes the first half of the work.
There doesn't appear to be a large form at work (at, least not one that's
easily audible to me).

0:00 - Concerto opens with lyrical tuba lines and orchestral interjections.

1:49 - Exploring the lower range of the tuba, as well as some interesting
muted brass techniques and dynamic swells.

2:32 - More motion in the tuba line.

3:50 - A brief section of staccato at a quick tempo in the tuba and orchestra,
then back to long lyrical tuba lines with orchestral backing.

5:43 - Some high-note double-tonguing in the tuba, accompanied by flutter-tongue
in the woodwinds.
Creates a pretty interesting texture.

6:23 - Tuba goes back to lyrical material; orchestra continues with the flutter
texture.

6:48 - Textural mimicry between the tuba and woodwinds.
(Then back to tuba melodic lines.)

9:39 - Another metered, lively staccato section.
Tuba eventually plays lyrical lines over staccato orchestral accompaniment.

10:07 - Return to relatively free time, sustained tuba parts with orchestral
interjections.
This section stays in the extreme low range of the tuba for quite a while.

11:43 - Back to the light staccato texture, with the tuba sometimes playing a
lyrical melody and sometimes participating in the staccato texture.
Variations of this are used until the end of the piece.

15:08 - A rather sudden sound-mass texture.
Soon returns to tuba melodies.

16:02 - Begins a staccato tuba line over flutter-tongued orchestral figures.
This lasts until the end of the piece.

The tuba playing on this recording sounds impressive to my ear; Baadsvik seems
adept at playing across the wide range required for this piece, and he
handles the long melody lines well.
The orchestra also does a good job of bringing out all of the interesting
interjections and extended techniques that they have.
With that said, if there's anything going on in terms of large-scale form in
this piece (which may not be the case), it didn't come through well to my ear
in the recording.
