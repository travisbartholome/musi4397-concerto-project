# What is this?

This is a list of contemporary concertos by Japanese composers.

Eventually, it should include one representative or interesting concerto from 15 different composers.

## Why?

I wanted to look into something different from what I'm familiar with,
but still something that had an approachable starting point.
I had encountered several great pieces by some contemporary Japanese
composers, so it seemed like an interesting topic to explore further.
There also isn't all that much English-language commentary or criticism about
classical music from Japan, even though there does seem to be a decent amount
of repertoire, and information in an academic context is even more sparse.
So it's kind of fun to explore.

## Works

## Notes

Since this is still a work in progress, I've left TODO comments on some things.
Particularly, I've been putting off transcribing or digging up some of the incipits.
A battle for another day.
