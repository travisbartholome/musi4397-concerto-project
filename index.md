# What is this?

This is a list of contemporary concertos by Japanese composers.

It includes one concerto from 10 different composers, then dives deeper
into the repertoire of some of the most prolific concerto composers in
that group (each of whom have written 10+ concertos that have been recorded).

## Why?

I wanted to look into something different from what I'm familiar with,
but still something that had an approachable starting point.
I had encountered several great pieces by some contemporary Japanese
composers, so it seemed like an interesting topic to explore further.
There also isn't all that much English-language commentary or criticism about
classical music from Japan (relative to that about music by Western composers),
even though there does seem to be a decent amount of repertoire, and
information in an academic context is even more sparse.
So it's kind of fun to explore.

## Works

These works are organized in chronological order, to give some idea of
how the composers relate to each other over time.

## Notes

There are other significant Japanese concerto composers whose work I was
unable to find a way to listen to (not available for streaming, recordings only
sold on Japanese CDs that are expensive and would also have to be imported).
So the composers represented here shouldn't be considered a complete list.

Also, my analysis style here consists of going through a recording and
providing timestamps for where interesting/important things happen.
Due to a lack of score availability, I can't really provide measure
numbers or do any score-based analysis, so everything is just done by ear.
For a similar reason, I sort of gave up on transcribing incipits after a while;
while it was doable and somewhat useful as a reference, it was taking a
ton of time and I think that timestamped themes in a recording are probably
more helpful for auditory analysis anyway (at least for me).
