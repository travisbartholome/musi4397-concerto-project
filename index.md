# What is this?

This is a list of contemporary concertos by Japanese composers.

It includes one concerto from 10 different composers, then dives deeper
into the repertoire of some of the most prolific concerto composers in
that group (each of whom have written 10+ concertos that have been recorded).

## Why?

I wanted to look into something different from what I'm familiar with,
but still something that had an approachable starting point.
I had encountered several great pieces by some contemporary Japanese
composers, so it seemed like an interesting topic to explore further.
There also isn't all that much English-language commentary or criticism about
classical music from Japan, even though there does seem to be a decent amount
of repertoire, and information in an academic context is even more sparse.
So it's kind of fun to explore.

## Notes

There are other significant Japanese concerto composers whose work I was
unable to find a way to listen to (not available for streaming, recordings only
sold on Japanese CDs that are expensive and would also have to be imported).
So the composers represented here shouldn't be considered a complete list.
